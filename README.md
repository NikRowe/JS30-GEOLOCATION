# JS30 Geolocation
Exercise 21 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

While this one is fairly simple compared to some of the previous days tutorials, as Wes stated this is because we are going through a "framework" free series and much of this geo data would be used to plug into frameworks such as google maps to then do something with that data. 

This tutorial was more about exploring xcode and seeing another platform for testing both mobile views, as well as native feature support.
